ZNU/Touhou User,#00CC00,10000,00.675111%,,"What you guys are referring to as Touhou, is in fact, ZNU/Touhou, or as I've recently taken to calling it, ZNU plus Touhou. Touhou is not a bullet hell unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning ZNU system made useful by the ZNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full waifu as defined by MOE. Many computer users run a modified version of the ZNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of ZNU which is widely used today is often called ""Touhou"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the ZNU system, developed by the ZNU Project. There really is a Touhou, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Touhou is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Touhou is normally used in combination with the ZNU operating system: the whole system is basically ZNU with Touhou added, or ZNU/Touhou. All the so-called ""Touhou"" distributions are really distributions of ZNU/Touhou. Thank you for taking your time to cooperate with with me, your friendly ZNU+Touhou neighbor, NamelessLegacy."
